# LolHelperApp
An app that helps you learn League of Legends and analyze your gameplay. 
A mobile app that won't be for sale but is meant to represent the website Mobalytics. 
I made this for my capstone project at Neumont college of computer science and it runs on Java made using Android Studio and has a Firebase database backend! 
If you do want this app in order to expand upon it or use then be my guest! 

There are three main pages to this app!
# Home Screen

This is where the app starts, you can either type in a summoner name to view the account or click on a favorite.

# Profile Page

Here you can view your profile, match history, and level as well as favorite this account so it shows up on the home screen.

# Skill Page

Here your skills will be assessed and you will get feedback on what your least proficient skill is, much like the Mobalytics.gg website!

This project was made for my capstone and has a lot of features that can be added and improved!
