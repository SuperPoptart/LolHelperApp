# LolHelperApp
An app that helps you learn League of Legends and analyze your gameplay. 
A mobile app that won't be for sale but is meant to represent the website Mobalytics. 
I made this for my capstone project at Neumont college of computer science and it runs on Java made using Android Studio and has a Firebase database backend! 
If you do want this app in order to expand upon it or use then be my guest!
